##Principles of Analytic Graphics
* 1 : Show comparisions
* 2 : Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
    - Frame works
* 3 : Show multivariate data
    - Multivariate = more than 2 variables
    - The real word = variables > 2
* 4 : Integrate multiple modes of evidence.
    - integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
    - Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
    - DON'T let the tool drive the analysis
* 5: Describe and document the evidence
    - With labels, scales, sources, etc.
    - A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
* 6 : Content is king
    - All depends on qualit, relevance, and integrity of their content.

| In another lesson, we gave you an overview
| of the three plotting systems in R. In this
| lesson we'll focus on the third and newest
| plotting system in R, ggplot2.  As we did
| with the other two systems, we'll focus on
| creating graphics on the screen device
| rather than another graphics device.

| The ggplot2 package is an add-on package
| available from CRAN via install.packages().
| (Don't worry, we've installed it for you
| already.) It is an implementation of The
| Grammar of Graphics, an abstract concept (as
| well as book) authored and invented by
| Leland Wilkinson and implemented by Hadley
| Wickham while he was a graduate student at
| Iowa State. The web site http://ggplot2.org
| provides complete documentation.

| A grammar of graphics represents an
| abstraction of graphics, that is, a theory
| of graphics which conceptualizes basic
| pieces from which you can build new graphics
| and graphical objects. The goal of the
| grammar is to â€œShorten the distance from
| mind to pageâ€. From Hadley Wickham's book we
| learn that

| The ggplot2 package "is composed of a set of
| independent components that can be composed
| in many different ways. ... you can create
| new graphics that are precisely tailored for
| your problem." These components include
| aesthetics which are attributes such as
| colour, shape, and size, and geometric
| objects or geoms such as points, lines, and
| bars.

| Before we delve into details, let's review
| the other 2 plotting systems.

...

  |======                               |  15%

| Recall what you know about R's base plotting
| system. Which of the following does NOT
| apply to it?

1: Start with plot (or similar) function
2: Use annotation functions to add/modify (text, lines, points, axis)
3: Can easily go back once the plot has started (e.g., to adjust margins or correct a typo)
4: It is convenient and mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data


Selection: 3

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |======                               |  18%

| Recall what you know about R's lattice
| plotting system. Which of the following does
| NOT apply to it?

1: Plots are created with a single function call (xyplot, bwplot, etc.)
2: Most useful for conditioning types of plots and putting many panels on one plot
3: Can always add to the plot once it is created
4: Margins and spacing are set automatically because entire plot is specified at once

| If we told you that ggplot2 combines the
| best of base and lattice, that would mean it

| Great job!

  |========                             |  22%

| Yes, ggplot2 combines the best of base and
| lattice. It allows for multipanel
| (conditioning) plots (as lattice does) but
| also post facto annotation (as base does),
| so you can add titles and labels. It uses
| the low-level grid package (which comes with
| R) to draw the graphics. As part of its
| grammar philosophy, ggplot2 plots are
| composed of aesthetics (attributes such as
| size, shape, color) and geoms (points,
| lines, and bars), the geometric objects you
| see on the plot.

...

  |=========                            |  25%

| The ggplot2 package has 2 workhorse
| functions. The more basic workhorse function
| is qplot, (think quick plot), which works
| like the plot function in the base graphics
| system. It can produce many types of plots
| (scatter, histograms, box and whisker) while
| hiding tedious details from the user.
| Similar to lattice functions, it looks for
| data in a data frame or parent environment.

...

  |==========                           |  28%

| The more advanced workhorse function in the
| package is ggplot, which is more flexible
| and can be customized for doing things qplot
| cannot do. In this lesson we'll focus on
| qplot.

...

  |===========                          |  30%

| We'll start by showing how easy and
| versatile qplot is. First, let's look at
| some data which comes with the ggplot2
| package. The mpg data frame contains fuel
| economy data for 38 models of cars
| manufactured in 1999 and 2008. Run the R
| command str with the argument mpg. This will
| give you an idea of what mpg contains.

> str(mpg)

| You are doing so well!

  |============                         |  32%

| We see that there are 234 points in the
| dataset concerning 11 different
| characteristics of the cars. Suppose we want
| to see if there's a correlation between
| engine displacement (displ) and highway
| miles per gallon (hwy). As we did with the
| plot function of the base system we could
| simply call qplot with 3 arguments, the
| first two are the variables we want to
| examine and the third argument data is set
| equal to the name of the dataset which
| contains them (in this case, mpg). Try this
| now.

> qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |=============                        |  35%

| A nice scatterplot done simply, right? All
| the labels are provided. The first argument
| is shown along the x-axis and the second
| along the y-axis. The negative trend
| (increasing displacement and lower gas
| mileage) is pretty clear. Now suppose we
| want to do the same plot but this time use
| different colors to distinguish between the
| 3 factors (subsets) of different types of
| drive (drv) in the data (front-wheel,
| rear-wheel, and 4-wheel). Again, qplot makes
| this very easy. We'll just add what ggplot2
| calls an aesthetic, a fourth argument,
| color, and set it equal to drv. Try this
| now. (Use the up arrow key to save some
| typing.)

> qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv)

| Excellent job!

  |==============                       |  38%

| Pretty cool, right? See the legend to the
| right which qplot helpfully supplied? The
| colors were automatically assigned by qplot
| so the legend decodes the colors for you.
| Notice that qplot automatically used dots or
| points to indicate the data. These points
| are geoms (geometric objects). We could have
| used a different aesthetic, for instance
| shape instead of color, to distinguish
| between the drive types.

...

  |===============                      |  40%

| Now let's add a second geom to the default
| points. How about some smoothing function to
| produce trend lines, one for each color?
| Just add a fifth argument, geom, and using
| the R function c(), set it equal to the
| concatenation of the two strings "point" and
| "smooth". The first refers to the data
| points and second to the trend lines we want
| plotted. Try this now.

> qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv, geom=c("point","smooth"))
geom_smooth: method="auto" and size of largest group is <1000, so using loess. Use 'method = x' to change the smoothing method.

| Nice work!

  |================                     |  43%

| Note the helpful message R returns in red
| telling you what function (loess) it used to
| create the trend lines. No need to worry -
| we'll see another example of method in
| another (Extras) lesson. Notice the gray
| areas surrounding each trend lines. These
| indicate the 95% confidence intervals for
| the lines.

...

  |=================                    |  45%

| Before we leave qplot's scatterplotting
| ability, call qplot again, this time with 3
| arguments. The first is y set equal to hwy,
| the second is data set equal to mpg, and the
| third is color set equal to drv. Try this
| now.

> qplot(hwy, data = mpg, color = drv)
stat_bin: binwidth defaulted to range/30. Use 'binwidth = x' to adjust this.

| Keep trying! Or, type info() for more
| options.

| Type qplot(y=hwy, data = mpg, color = drv)
| at the command prompt.

> qplot(y=hwy, data = mpg, color = drv)

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |==================                   |  48%

| What's this plot showing? We see the x-axis
| ranges from 0 to 250 and we remember that we
| had 234 data points in our set, so we can
| infer that each point in the plot represents
| one of the hwy values (indicated by the
| y-axis). We've created the vector myhigh for
| you which contains the hwy data from the mpg
| dataset. Look at myhigh now.

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |==================                   |  50%

| Comparing the values of myhigh with the
| plot, we see the first entries in the vector
| (29, 29, 31, 30,...) correspond to the
| leftmost points in the the plot (in order),
| and the last entries in myhigh (28, 29, 26,
| 26, 26) correspond to the rightmost plotted
| points. So, specifying the y parameter only,
| without an x argument, plots the values of
| the y argument in the order in which they
| occur in the data.

...

  |===================                  |  52%

| The all-purpose qplot can also create box
| and whisker plots.  Call qplot now with 4
| arguments. First specify the variable by
| which you'll split the data, in this case
| drv, then specify the variable which you
| want to examine, in this case hwy. The third
| argument is data (set equal to mpg), and the
| fourth, the geom, set equal to the string
| "boxplot"

> qplot(drv,hwy,data=mpg,geom="boxplot")

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |====================                 |  55%

| We see 3 boxes, one for each drive. Now to
| impress you, call qplot with 5 arguments.
| The first 4 are just as you used previously,
| (drv, hwy, data set equal to mpg, and geom
| set equal to the string "boxplot"). Now add
| a fifth argument, color, equal to
| manufacturer.

> qplot(drv,hwy,data=mpg,geom="boxplot",color=manufacturer)

| You are really on a roll!

  |=====================                |  58%

| It's a little squished but we just wanted to
| illustrate qplot's capabilities. Notice that
| there are still 3 regions of the plot
| (determined by the factor drv). Each is
| subdivided into several boxes depicting
| different manufacturers.

...

  |======================               |  60%

| Now, on to histograms. These display
| frequency counts for a single variable.
| Let's start with an easy one. Call qplot
| with 3 arguments. First specify the variable
| for which you want the frequency count, in
| this case hwy, then specify the data (set
| equal to mpg), and finally, the aesthetic,
| fill, set equal to drv. Instead of a plain
| old histogram, this will again use colors to
| distinguish the 3 different drive factors.

> qplot(hwy,data=mpg, set = drv)
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'drv' not found
> qplot(hwy,data=mpg,color=drv)
stat_bin: binwidth defaulted to range/30. Use 'binwidth = x' to adjust this.

| Almost! Try again. Or, type info() for more
| options.

| Type qplot(hwy, data = mpg, fill = drv) at
| the command prompt.

> qplot(hwy,data=mpg,fill=drv)
stat_bin: binwidth defaulted to range/30. Use 'binwidth = x' to adjust this.

| You are really on a roll!

  |=======================              |  62%

| See how qplot consistently uses the colors.
| Red (if 4-wheel drv is in the bin) is at the
| bottom of the bin, then green on top of it
| (if present), followed by blue (rear wheel
| drv). The color lets us see right away that
| 4-wheel drive vehicles in this dataset don't
| have gas mileages exceeding 30 miles per
| gallon.

...

  |========================             |  65%

| It's cool that qplot can do this so easily,
| but some people may find this multi-color
| histogram hard to interpret. Instead of
| using colors to distinguish between the
| drive factors let's use facets or panels.
| (That's what lattice called them.) This just
| means we'll split the data into 3 subsets
| (according to drive) and make 3 smaller
| individual plots of each subset in one plot
| (and with one call to qplot).

...

  |=========================            |  68%

| Remember that with base plot we had to do
| each subplot individually. The lattice
| system made plotting conditioning plots
| easier. Let's see how easy it is with qplot.

...

  |==========================           |  70%

| We'll do two plots, a scatterplot and then a
| histogram, each with 3 facets. For the
| scatterplot, call qplot with 4 arguments.
| The first two are displ and hwy and the
| third is the argument data set equal to mpg.
| The fourth is the argument facets which will
| be set equal to the expression . ~ drv which
| is ggplot2's shorthand for number of rows
| (to the left of the ~) and number of columns
| (to the right of the ~). Here the .
| indicates a single row and drv implies 3,
| since there are 3 distinct drive factors.
| Try this now.

  |===========================          |  73%

| The result is a 1 by 3 array of plots. Note
| how each is labeled at the top with the
| factor label (4,f, or r). This shows us more
| detailed information than the histogram. We
| see the relationship between displacement
| and highway mileage for each of the 3 drive
| factors.

...

  |============================         |  75%

| Now we'll do a histogram, again calling
| qplot with 4 arguments. This time, since we
| need only one variable for a histogram, the
| first is hwy and the second is the argument
| data set equal to mpg. The third is the
| argument facets which we'll set equal to the
| expression drv ~ . . This will give us a
| different arrangement of the facets. The
| fourth argument is binwidth. Set this equal
| to 2. Try this now.

> qplot(hwy,data = mpg, facets = drv ~ ., binwidth = 2)

| You are doing so well!

  |==                                                                               |   3%

| In this lesson, we'll give you a brief overview of the three plotting systems in R,
| their differences, strengths, and weaknesses. We'll only cover the basics here to give
| you a general idea of the systems and in later lessons we'll cover each system in more
| depth.

...

  |====                                                                             |   6%

| The first plotting system is the Base Plotting System which comes with R. It's the
| oldest system which uses a simple "Artist's palette" model. What this means is that you
| start with a blank canvas and build your plot up from there, step by step.

...

  |=======                                                                          |   8%

| Usually you start with a plot function (or something similar), then you use annotation
| functions to add to or modify your plot. R provides many annotating functions such as
| text, lines, points, and axis. R provides documentation for each of these. They all add
| to an already existing plot.

...

  |=========                                                                        |  11%

| What do you think is a disadvantage of the Base Plotting System?

1: It mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data
2: It's intuitive and exploratory
3: You can't go back once a plot has started
4: A complicated plot is a series of simple R commands

Selection: 3

| That's a job well done!

  |===========                                                                      |  14%

| Yes! The base system is very intuitive and easy to use when you're starting to do
| exploratory graphing and looking for a research direction. You can't go backwards,
| though, say, if you need to readjust margins or fix a misspelled a caption. A finished
| plot will be a series of R commands, so it's difficult to translate a finished plot into
| a different system.

...

  |==============                                                                   |  17%

| We've loaded the dataset cars for you to demonstrate how easy it is to plot. First, use
| the R command head with cars as an argument to see what the data looks like.


> head(cars)
  speed dist
1     4    2
2     4   10
3     7    4
4     7   22
5     8   16
6     9   10

| Great job!

  |================                                                                 |  19%

| So the dataset collates the speeds and distances needed to stop for 50 cars. This data
| was recorded in the 1920's.

...

  |==================                                                               |  22%

| We'll use the R command with which takes two arguments. The first specifies a dataset or
| environment in which to run the second argument, an R expression. This will save us a
| bit of typing. Try running the command with now using cars as the first argument and a
| call to plot as the second. The call to plot will take two arguments, speed and dist.
| Please specify them in that order.

> with(cars, plot(speed, dist))

| Great job!

  |====================                                                             |  25%

| Simple, right? You can see the relationship between the two variables, speed and
| distance. The first variable is plotted along the x-axis and the second along the
| y-axis.

...

  |======================                                                           |  28%

| Now we'll show you what the function text does. Run the command text with three
| arguments. The first two, x and y coordinates, specify the placement of the third
| argument, the text to be added to the plot. Let the first argument be mean(cars$speed),
| the second max(cars$dist), and the third the string "SWIRL rules!". Try it now.

> text(mean(cars$speed), max(cars$dist), "SWIRL rules!")

| You are really on a roll!

  |=========================                                                        |  31%

| Ain't it the truth?

...

  |===========================                                                      |  33%

| Now we'll move on to the second plotting system, the Lattice System which comes in the
| package of the same name. Unlike the Base System, lattice plots are created with a
| single function call such as xyplot or bwplot. Margins and spacing are set automatically
| because the entire plot is specified at once.

...

  |=============================                                                    |  36%

| The lattice system is most useful for conditioning types of plots which display how y
| changes with x across levels of z. The variable z might be a categorical variable of
| your data. This system is also good for putting many plots on a screen at once.

...

  |===============================                                                  |  39%

| The lattice system has several disadvantages. First, it is sometimes awkward to specify
| an entire plot in a single function call. Annotating a plot may not be especially
| intuitive. Second, using panel functions and subscripts is somewhat difficult and
| requires preparation. Finally, you cannot "add" to the plot once it is created as you
| can with the base system.

...

  |==================================                                               |  42%

| As before, we've loaded some data for you in the variable state. This data comes with
| the lattice package and it concerns various characteristics of the 50 states in the U.S.
| Use the R command head to see the first few entries of state now.

| Nice work!

  |====================================                                             |  44%

| As you can see state holds 9 pieces of information for each of the 50 states. The last
| variable, region, specifies a category for each state. Run the R command table with the
| argument state$region to see how many categories there are and how many states are in
| each.

> table(state$region)

    Northeast         South North Central          West 
            9            16            12            13 

| You are really on a roll!

  |======================================                                           |  47%

| So there are 4 categories and the 50 states are sorted into them appropriately. Let's
| use the lattice command xyplot to see how life expectancy varies with income in each of
| the four regions.

...

  |========================================                                         |  50%

| To do this we'll give xyplot 3 arguments. The first is the most complicated. It is this
| R formula, Life.Exp ~ Income | region, which indicates we're plotting life expectancy as
| it depends on income for each region. The second argument, data, is set equal to state.
| This allows us to use "Life.Exp" and "Income" in the formula instead of specifying the
| dataset state for each term (as in state$Income). The third argument, layout, is set
| equal to the two-long vector c(4,1). Run xyplot now with these three arguments.

> xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region,data = state,layout = c(4,1))
There were 12 warnings (use warnings() to see them)

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |===========================================                                      |  53%

| We see the data for each of the 4 regions plotted in one row. Based on this plot, which
| region of the U.S. seems to have the shortest life expectancy?

1: South
2: North Central
3: West
4: Northeast

Selection: 1

| Nice work!

  |=============================================                                    |  56%

| Just for fun rerun the xyplot and this time set layout to the vector c(2,2). To save typing use the
| up arrow to recover the previous xyplot command.

> xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region,data = state,layout = c(2,2))

| You are amazing!

  |===============================================                                  |  58%

| See how the plot changed? No need for you to worry about margins or labels. The package took care
| of all that for you.

...

  |=================================================                                |  61%

| Now for the last plotting system, ggplot2, which is a hybrid of the base and lattice systems. It
| automatically deals with spacing, text, titles (as Lattice does) but also allows you to annotate by
| "adding" to a plot (as Base does), so it's the best of both worlds.

...

  |====================================================                             |  64%

| Although ggplot2 bears a superficial similarity to lattice, it's generally easier and more
| intuitive to use. Its default mode makes many choices for you but you can still customize a lot.
| The package is based on a "grammar of graphics" (hence the gg in the name), so you can control the
| aesthetics of your plots. For instance, you can plot conditioning graphs and panel plots as we did
| in the lattice example.

...

  |======================================================                           |  67%

| We'll see an example now of ggplot2 with a simple (single) command. As before, we've loaded a
| dataset for you from the ggplot2 package. This mpg data holds fuel economy data between 1999 and
| 2008 for 38 different models of cars. Run head with mpg as an argument so you get an idea of what
| the data looks like.

> head(mpg)
  manufacturer model displ year cyl      trans drv cty hwy fl   class

6         audi    a4   2.8 1999   6 manual(m5)   f  18  26  p compact

| You got it!

  |========================================================                         |  69%

| Looks complicated. Run dim with the argument mpg to see how big the dataset is.

> dim(mpg)
[1] 234  11

| That's correct!

  |==========================================================                       |  72%

| Holy cow! That's a lot of information for just 38 models of cars. Run the R command table with the
| argument mpg$model. This will tell us how many models of cars we're dealing with.

| Oh, there are 38 models. We're interested in the effect engine displacement (displ) has on highway
| gas mileage (hwy), so we'll use the ggplot2 command qplot to display this relationship. Run qplot
| now with three arguments. The first two are the variables displ and hwy we want to plot, and the
| third is the argument data set equal to mpg. As before, this allows us to avoid using the
| mpg$variable notation for the first two arguments.

> qplot(displ,hwy, data = mpg)
